  # unit tests for get_request_log
  # Gets a request logging log file.
  # Retrieves information for a single log entry.  **Request** The &#x60;requestLogfId&#x60; property can be retrieved by getting the list of log entries. The Content-Transfer-Encoding header can be set to base64 to retrieve the API request/response as base 64 string. Otherwise the bytes of the request/response are returned.  **Response** If the Content-Transfer-Encoding header was set to base64, the log is returned as a base64 string.

  # unit tests for get_request_log_settings
  # Gets the API request logging settings.
  # Retrieves the current API request logging setting for the user and remaining log entries.  **Response** The response includes the current API request logging setting for the user, along with the maximum log entries and remaining log entries.

  # unit tests for get_resources
  # Lists resources for REST version specified
  # Retrieves the base resources available for the DocuSign REST APIs.  You do not need an integrator key to view the REST API versions and resources.  Example: https://demo.docusign.net/restapi/v2 lists all of the base resources available in version 2 of the REST API on the DocuSign Demo system.  To view descriptions and samples of the service operations for all versions, remove the version number and add /help to the URL.  Example: https://demo.docusign.net/restapi/help lists the REST API operations on the DocuSign Demo system with XML and JSON request and response samples.

  # unit tests for list_request_logs
  # Gets the API request logging log files.
  # Retrieves a list of log entries as a JSON or xml object or as a zip file containing the entries.  If the Accept header is set to application/zip, the response is a zip file containing individual text files, each representing an API request.  If the Accept header is set to &#x60;application/json&#x60; or &#x60;application/xml&#x60;, the response returns list of log entries in either JSON or XML. An example JSON response body is shown below. 
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters

  # unit tests for update_request_log_settings
  # Enables or disables API request logging for troubleshooting.
  # Enables or disables API request logging for troubleshooting.  When enabled (&#x60;apiRequestLogging&#x60; is set to true), REST API requests and responses for the user are added to a log. A log can have up to 50 requests/responses and the current number of log entries can be determined by getting the settings. Logging is automatically disabled when the log limit of 50 is reached.  You can call [ML:GetRequestLog] or [ML:GetRequestLogs] to download the log files (individually or as a zip file). Call [ML:DeleteRequestLogs] to clear the log by deleting current entries.  Private information, such as passwords and integrator key information, which is normally located in the call header is omitted from the request/response log.  ###### Note: API request logging only captures requests from the authenticated user. Any call that does not authenticate the user and resolve a userId isn&#39;t logged. Meaning that login_information, NewAccounts, or other distributor-credential calls are not logged.
