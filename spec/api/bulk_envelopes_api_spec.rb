  # unit tests for get
  # Gets the status of a specified bulk send operation.
  # Retrieves the status information of a single bulk recipient batch. A bulk recipient batch is the set of envelopes sent from a single bulk recipient file. 
  # @param account_id The external account number (int) or account ID Guid.

  # @option opts [String] :count Specifies the number of entries to return.
  # @option opts [String] :include Specifies which entries are included in the response. Multiple entries can be included by using commas in the query string (example: ?include&#x3D;”failed,queued”)   Valid values are:   * all - Returns all entries. If present, overrides all other query settings. This is the default if no query string is provided. * failed - This only returns entries with a failed status. * queued - This only returns entries with a queued status. * sent – This only returns entries with a sent status.  
  # @option opts [String] :start_position Specifies the location in the list of envelopes from which to start.

  # Gets status information about bulk recipient batches.
  # Retrieves status information about all the bulk recipient batches. A bulk recipient batch is the set of envelopes sent from a single bulk recipient file. The response includes general information about each bulk recipient batch.   The response returns information about the envelopes sent with bulk recipient batches, including the &#x60;batchId&#x60; property, which can be used to retrieve a more detailed status of individual bulk recipient batches.
