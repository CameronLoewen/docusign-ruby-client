  # unit tests for create_signatures
  # Adds user Signature and initials images to a Signature.
  # Adds a user signature image and/or user initials image to the specified user.   The userId property specified in the endpoint must match the authenticated user&#39;s userId and the user must be a member of the account.  The rules and processes associated with this are:  * If Content-Type is set to application/json, then the default behavior for creating a default signature image, based on the name and a DocuSign font, is used. * If Content-Type is set to multipart/form-data, then the request must contain a first part with the user signature information, followed by parts that contain the images.  For each Image part, the Content-Disposition header has a \&quot;filename\&quot; value that is used to map to the &#x60;signatureName&#x60; and/or &#x60;signatureInitials&#x60; properties in the JSON to the image.   For example:  &#x60;Content-Disposition: file; filename&#x3D;\&quot;Ron Test20121127083900\&quot;&#x60;  If no matching image (by filename value) is found, then the image is not set. One, both, or neither of the signature and initials images can be set with this call.  The Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64 header, set in the header for the part containing the image, can be set to indicate that the images are formatted as base64 instead of as binary.  If successful, 200-OK is returned, and a JSON structure containing the signature information is provided, note that the signatureId can change with each API POST, PUT, or DELETE since the changes to the signature structure cause the current signature to be closed, and a new signature record to be created.

The limit is 4,000 characters, which includes the XML and JSON structure for the settings.  ### Grouping Custom User Settings ###  You can group custom user settings when adding them. Grouping allows you to retrieve settings that are in a specific group, instead of retrieving all the user custom settings.  To group custom user settings, add the following information in the header, after Content-Type:  &#x60;X-DocuSign-User-Settings-Key:group_name&#x60;  Where the &#x60;group_name&#x60; is your designated name for the group of customer user settings. Grouping is shown in the Example Request Body below.  When getting or deleting grouped custom user settings, you must include the extra header information.  Grouping custom user settings is not required and if the extra header information is not included, the custom user settings are added normally and can be retrieved or deleted without including the additional header.

  # unit tests for update_signature
  # Updates the user signature for a specified user.
  # Creates, or updates, the signature font and initials for the specified user. When creating a signature, you use this resource to create the signature name and then add the signature and initials images into the signature.  ###### Note: This will also create a default signature for the user when one does not exist.  The userId property specified in the endpoint must match the authenticated user&#39;s user ID and the user must be a member of the account.  The &#x60;signatureId&#x60; parameter accepts a signature ID or a signature name. DocuSign recommends you use signature ID (&#x60;signatureId&#x60;), since some names contain characters that do not properly encode into a URL. If you use the user name, it is likely that the name includes spaces. In that case, URL encode the name before using it in the endpoint.   For example encode \&quot;Bob Smith\&quot; as \&quot;Bob%20Smith\&quot;.
  # @param account_id The external account number (int) or account ID Guid.
  # @param signature_id The ID of the signature being accessed.
  # @param user_id The user ID of the user being accessed. Generally this is the user ID of the authenticated user, but if the authenticated user is an Admin on the account, this may be another user the Admin user is accessing.
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [String] :close_existing_signature When set to **true**, closes the current signature.
  # @option opts [UserSignatureDefinition] :user_signature_definition 
  # @return [UserSignature]
